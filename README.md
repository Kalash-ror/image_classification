Image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is a deep learning technique that involves training a neural network to recognize and categorize images. CNNs extract meaningful features from the images through convolutional layers, followed by pooling and fully connected layers, enabling accurate classification of various objects, scenes, or patterns within the images.
